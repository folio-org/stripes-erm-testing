# Api
This directory houses files which can export individual api calls, rather than interactions with the UI, (Those belong in fragments as Interactor classes)

These can be used to perform API requests behind the scenes where UI interactions do not necessarily take place, allowing then for integration testing of non-ui features, as well as allowing for usage of certain API features to be used within UI tests.
